Git hooks are scripts that Git executes automatically every time particular event occures in a Git repository.  
Every Git repository has a `.git/hooks` folder with a script for each hook you can bind to.  


!!! Tip
    Add `.git`  folder to VSCode
    ```
    files.exclude": {
        "**/.git": false
    }
    ```


## Sample
```
```

!!! Warning
    Don't forget to assign executable permission
